Hello Everyone,
Today, we'll look at the difference between the C++ and Python in terms of programming time.
We will run the (for) Query for thousands,ten thousand, lakh times in both the C++ and Python.

For Query(Frequency)             Code Blocks Timing             VS Code Timing
1000                              seconds              0.513923 seconds
10000                             seconds              4.950590 seconds
100000                            seconds                        seconds

As you can see that Python takes less time than the C++.
Here We use TDM GCC for C++ and Python 3.8.

Thank you Everyone,
